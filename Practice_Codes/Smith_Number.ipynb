    "- Smith numbers are only composite (non-prime) numbers, meaning prime numbers cannot be Smith numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smith numbers are particularly interesting topic for mathematical exploration because, unlike prime numbers, they exhibit a unique relationship between their factors and their digits.\n",

    "- These features make Smith numbers both educational and intriguing as a subject of study.\n",
