    "## **Number Guessing Game**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A group of students wants to develop a fun game that they can play in their free time. The game should be simple and easy to understand, providing players with an enjoyable way to pass the time. With this in mind, they decide to create a number guessing game. This game will allow players to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100 within a certain number of attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manually guessing and checking a number can be time-consuming and challenging. Additionally, a software solution is needed to make the game more organized and user-friendly. This will allow users to guess more comfortably and reach the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Instructions**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Starting the Game:\n",
    "        Display a welcome message to the players and explain the rules of the game.\n",
    "        Randomly select a number between 1 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Making a Guess:\n",
    "        Give players 10 attempts to guess the number.\n",
    "        Prompt the user to input a valid number.\n",
    "        Check the user's guess and indicate whether it is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Reducing Attempt Count:\n",
    "        After each guess, reduce the remaining number of attempts by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Winning or Losing the Game:\n",
    "        If the user guesses correctly, announce that they have won the game and end the game.\n",
    "        If the attempts run out, reveal the correct number to the user and end the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Option to Replay:\n",
    "        Ask the player if they want to play the game again.\n",
    "        If the user wants to replay, restart the game; if not, end the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Program Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Display a welcome message to the player and explain the rules.\n",
    "- Randomly select a number between 1 and 100.\n",
    "- Give the user 10 attempts and ask them to make a guess.\n",
    "- Check the user's guess and provide appropriate feedback.\n",
    "- Reduce the number of attempts by one.\n",
    "- If the user guesses correctly, announce that they have won the game and end it.\n",
    "- If the attempts run out, reveal the correct number and end the game.\n",
    "- Ask the user if they want to play again.\n",
    "- If the user wants to replay, restart the game; if not, end the game.\n",
