    "## **Body Mass Index (BMI)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a measure used to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight relative to their height. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It's widely used as a simple screening tool to categorize individuals into different weight categories that may indicate potential health risks, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How is BMI Calculated?**\n",
    "- The BMI is calculated using the following formula : \n",
    "\n",
    "```BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m) ** 2)```\n",
    "\n",
    "```Weight``` : The weight of the individual in kilograms (kg).\n",
    "\n",
    "```Height``` : The height of the individual in meters (m).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Interpretation of BMI Values**\n",
    "- Once the BMI is calculated, it falls into one of the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Underweight``` : BMI less than 18.5 \n",
    "\n",
    "```Normal weight``` : BMI between 18.5 and 24.9\n",
    "\n",
    "```Overweight``` : BMI between 25 and 29.9\n",
    "\n",
    "```Obesity``` : BMI of 30 or greater\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**\n",
    "- For a person who weighs 70 kilograms and is 1.75 meters tall, the BMI would be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```22.86 = 70 (kg) / (1.75 (m) ** 2)``` : This BMI falls within the ```Normal weight``` category.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Limitations of BMI**\n",
    "- While BMI is a useful general indicator of health, it has limitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It does not account for the distribution of fat in the body, muscle mass, or other factors like age, gender, and ethnicity. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Therefore, while BMI can provide a quick assessment, it's not a definitive measure of health, and other assessments may be necessary for a comprehensive evaluation."
